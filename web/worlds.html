                <p>
                    Viliya is a fantasy-medieval realm with two distinct continents, Garaskar and Olia, separated by the island of Garakz.
                    Garaskar, the "old world," is a land of ancient origins, filled with diverse landscapes such as towering mountains, tropical forests,
                    vast deserts, and mighty rivers. It is home to the dominant Khiz Empire in the north, the mountainous Kingdom of Qeqe in the central
                    Gorz range, and the war-torn southern regions where the Brotherhood of Rhek and the Qakicath Empire battle endlessly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Garakz, the island between the continents, is sparsely populated but renowned for its exclusive garakzon wine, crafted from
                    fruits that thrive only in its unique environment. The Kingdom of Garakz rules the island.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Olia offers a striking contrast to Garaskar, with its endless green forests, expansive fields, and rich biodiversity.
                    Once united under a powerful nation, it is now divided into three major khanates—Gurbugant, Gallia, and Olindoria—while its
                    southern lands are a patchwork of smaller states, with Khovdia being the largest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Magic exists in Viliya but is rare, with only a few traces of magical phenomena scattered across the world. Ancient relics,
                    hidden deep within the ruins of forgotten civilizations, are said to hold mysterious powers, and rumors of enchanted creatures
                    roaming the remote forests of Olia persist among travelers. Some individuals, known as the "Touched," possess minor magical
                    abilities—often seen as both a blessing and a curse—yet these powers are unpredictable and difficult to control. While the empires
                    and kingdoms seek to harness these forces, true mastery over magic remains an elusive and dangerous pursuit.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Hundreth was one of the most powerful " Touched" in Viliya’s history, a solitary figure who defied empires and waged a one-man war
                    against the world. With his unmatched ability to manipulate the elements and bend the forces of nature, he became a force of chaos,
                    challenging the authority of the Khiz Empire and the southern states alike. Moving through the realms as a shadow, he unleashed his
                    power to disrupt armies, shatter cities, and alter landscapes. His relentless crusade during the "Shattered Years" left a legacy of
                    fear and awe, as the scars of his battles still mark the lands he once roamed.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Dolequa Itarakus, the "Insatiable Demon," is a towering beast, standing at a height of around 10 meters. It roams the great
                    hills of Bando in central Olia, moving on two powerful legs—its only limbs. Its entire body is covered in jagged horns that
                    protrude from its thick hide, giving it a fearsome and grotesque appearance. The creature’s monstrous footsteps send tremors
                    through the earth, and its bellowing roars echo across the hills, striking terror into anyone who hears them. Elusive and
                    ferocious, Dolequa Itarakus is a force of nature that leaves devastation in its wake, as no one who crosses its path returns
                    unscathed.

                <p style="margin-top:40px">
                    The Khiz Empire's army is the most formidable military force in Viliya, a well-disciplined and highly trained legion that
                    dominates the northern lands of Garaskar. Comprising thousands of heavily armored infantry, mounted cavalry, and elite archers,
                    it moves as a single, cohesive unit, with strategies honed over centuries of warfare. The army's strength lies in its
                    adaptability, capable of fighting in the scorching deserts, dense jungles, and rugged mountain passes of Garaskar. Commanded
                    by experienced generals, each division of the Khiz forces is supported by war machines and siege equipment, making it a
                    relentless and unstoppable force. Feared across the continent, the sight of their black-and-gold banners strikes terror into
                    the hearts of their enemies, as the Khiz Empire’s army leaves little chance for victory against those who stand in its path.
